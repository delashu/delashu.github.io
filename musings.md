## Musings

<h2>  Stockholm  <sub><sup>(July, 2023)</sup></sub></h2> 
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
Stockholm, Sweden: 
I'm obliged to start my musings by acknowleding that I spent a week in Stockholm during the summertime - the time of year in Sweden when the days are long, the flowers are blooming, restaurant outdoor seating is plentiful, and Vitamin D supplements aren't necessary. The winters on the otherhand, I hear are miserable. Perhaps it is this dichotomy along with the brevity of the summer days that make the locals savor every last ray of the sun, glowing in the fresh Scandanavian air (I swear to you the Swedes glow differently in the sun). <BR>
And honestly, they have every reason to be out there enjoying the quietly aesthetic city that is Stockholm. The smattering of colors that somehow work, the cool breeze off the water, the mix of cars, boats, trains, kayaks, and bikes all traversing the city - none of it was 'in your face'. It all felt just-right and unforced. Similarly, my stay in stockholm felt unforced, consisting of a healthy mix of the usual touristy attractions, exploring the city by foot, and eating the local cuisine.  <BR>  

  <li>The Vasa Museum lives up to the hype and should not be missed. The museum commemorates a benemouth warship that sank shortly after its first departure. Despite the failed functionality of the boat, it remains a testament of labor and artistry. </li>  
  <li>I found pleasure in bathing in the greenery and waterscape of each park and walking path we explored. Bellevue parken has a walking path where you may come across locals grilling in the firepits, kayakers, small lakeside restaurants that serve aperol spritz, and tennis being played on red clay courts. We opted to kick a ball around on one of the turf fields.  </li>  
  <li>Kayaking Stockholm provides a distinctive perspective of the architecture and city layout. I found myself looking at the urban sprawl of Stockholm from my kayak and being surprised by the harmony of it all - the different modes of transit moving in unison, the colors on the buildings, the calm water, and how strangely quiet it was. No honking, no yelling, none of the cacophany that I associate with urban settings. </li>  
  <li>We explored Vaxholm for a day and it was the ideal quick and easy get away from the city center that we were looking for. If you find yourself over there, give in and buy a carton of strawberries. Strawberries, or jordgubbe (literal translation: 'earth-lads' ) hit different in Sweden. While we explored the more residential areas of Vaxholm, an older woman who lived in one of the lakeside houses waved us down and gave us her pleasantries from her massive picturesque terrace. I couldn't hear a word of she said, but the image of her waving while surrounded by her flowers in the blue sky and sun is my lasting memory of Vaxholm. </li>  
<BR>
Ok so, I saved my best impression of Stockholm (and arguably the most important) for last. <BR>  
The pastries. <BR> 
The pastries in Stockholm kick so much ass. <BR> 
I cannot stress enough how fantastic the pastries were. I woke up excited every morning, since waking up meant that I was nearer to consuming yet another Swedish pastry for breakfast. Every bite of every pastry was utter enjoyment. You know that satisfaction of biting into your favorite food? That magical moment when all the flavors come in contact with your tongue? I felt that delight every damn morning in Stockholm. 
Kardemommeboller (cardamom buns), Kanelbulle (cinnamon roll), Hallongrotta (no idea what the American equivalent is???), Prinsesstårta (princess cake), you name it - didn't matter what it was and it didn't matter which cafe we ate at. It was all magic. <BR> 
I'll be back for the Kardemommeboller.

<h2>  Best books I read in 2020  <sub><sup>(December, 2020)</sup></sub></h2> 
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><b>The Lady Tasting Tea (Salsburg)</b><BR>
The more I journey into the study of statistics, the more I see it as a philosophical science. Perhaps the rigorous endeavor of any subject results in using the subject’s laws to make sense of our reality. Even so, I thought I would write a few of the lasting impressions that this book and statistics as a whole – a science typically not seen in a philosophical light - leaves on my worldview. <BR>
Statistics attempts to make sense of reality by assigning quantities such as proportions, risks, and probabilities to events. Underlying this process is how these events are generated. In statistical jargon, this is often termed the “data generating mechanism”. Salsburg provides a historical account of the science community’s evolving ideas on how the events in our world are generated. Two camps of thought are brought to light in this regard: The Deterministic and Random camps. <BR>
A deterministic worldview, propelled by Newtonian physics in the nineteenth century, is centered by the idea that reality is governed by predetermined forces. Thus as science advances and the precision of measurements improves, we get closer to the true governing forces that rule reality (i.e. the gravitational constant). In this framework, randomness does not exist. Rather, science has not yet discovered the laws that govern our reality, and thus the assignment of what we do not understand as “random” is erroneous. <BR>
Karl Pearson deviated from deterministic thought in the early twentieth century and conceived of the distribution function, claiming that statistical distributions describe the fundamental randomness of reality. Pearson spearheaded the “Random” camp, asserting that observable phenomena are a result of a bunch of random processes. The gravitational constant in this framework is not one specific value, but rather is derived from a distribution of gravitational constants. The gravitation constant we use, 6.67 × 10^-11, is the value that is most likely to be observed from all the experiments we have performed.<BR>
Irrespective of whether one believes in randomness or determinism, modern sciences stand on the foundation of Pearson’s mathematical distribution functions – a fact that is often overlooked. Pearson’s groundwork led to the birth of maximum likelihood, hypothesis testing, and p-values (heavy lifting from Fisher), which stand as absolutes in modern science. <BR>
It’s easy to get lost in the minutiae while studying statistics, but this book and Pearson appeal to re-evaluating concepts, equations, and formulas from a grander perspective. A once contrarian philosophy that our world is random rather than determined has led to the fruition of a scientific revolution and continued imprint in modern discovery. </li>

<li><b>Convenience Store Woman (Murata)</b><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Until now, we’d always had meaningful worker-manager discussions: “It’s been hot lately, so the sales of chocolate desserts are down,” or “There’s a new block of flats down the road, so we’ve been getting more customers in the evening”… Now, however, it felt like he’d downgraded me from store worker to female of the human species.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>This passage from Murata was perfect - hilarious, sad, and a bit sobering. Murata’s efficacy lies in allowing the reader to simultaneously relate and collide with Miss Furukawa’s psyche. We cheer for her, are confused by her, laugh at her, and laugh with her. I grappled with all of these thoughts and then some when reading this passage and the rest of Murata’s novel.</li>

<li><b>Embracing Defeat (Dower)</b><BR>
The process of the post-WWII democratization, demilitarization, and liberation of the collective Japanese mind from a power-hungry empire was, to say the least, complex. Inevitably, the undertaking of such a sweeping process comes with its fair share of consequences. Dower’s succinctly illuminates the lasting effects of these consequences:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>“For all their talk of democracy, the conquerors worked hard to engineer consensus; and on many critical issues, they made clear that the better part of political wisdom was silence and conformism. So well did they succeed in reinforcing this consciousness that after they left, and time passed, many non-Japanese including Americans came to regard such attitudes as peculiarly Japanese.”</I></BLOCKQUOTE>What an insightful passage. While it is true that there existed a conception that Japanese were silent and conformist pre-occupation, the result of occupation-led censorship and control perpetuated and more importantly made these traits truly tangible – especially to the rest of the world. Perhaps most mind racking is the stark contrast of the legacies left behind of these actions. The conquerors brought democracy and order swiftly without making too much noise. Yet they left behind some of today’s most quintessential traits of the Japanese.</li>
